    <h2>2. hosting</h2>
    <h3>External hosting</h3>
    <p>
      Our hoster collects the following data in so-called log files, which your
      browser transmits: IP address, the address of the previously visited
      website (referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone
      difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status
      code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request came and
      information about the browser and operating system. This is necessary to
      display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds
      to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
      f DSGVO. There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this
      data, but only receive an anonymized statistical summary. This includes
      the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page
      viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with
      other data.
    </p>
    <p>We use the following hoster to make our website available:</p>
    <p>GitHub Inc.</p>
    <p>88 Colin P Kelly Jr St</p>
    <p>San Francisco, CA 94107</p>
    <p>United States</p>
    <p>
      This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our
      legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO,
      not to have to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server
      location is USA.
    </p>

      GitHub at:
      https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages
      You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is
      successful is to be determined in the context of a balancing of interests.
      The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing ceases
      to apply. The processing of the data provided under this section is not
      required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not
      guaranteed without the processing. GitHub has implemented compliance
      measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global
      activities where GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU.
      These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

    <h2>3. general notes and obligatory information</h2>
    <h3>Data protection</h3>
    <p>
      The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
      very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
      accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data
      protection declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal
      data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy
      policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
      explains how and for what purpose this is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.
      when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection
      of data against access by third parties is not possible.
    </p>
    <h3>Note on the responsible party</h3>
    <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p>
      Marc Reetz<br />
      Industriesta√üe 7<br />
      27211 Bassum
    </p>
    <h2>Contactt</h2>
    <p>
      Phone: 01520 5228269<br />
      E-Mail: m.reetz.software@gmail.com
    </p>
    <p>
      The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly
      with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of
      personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses or similar).
    </p>
    <h3>Storage period</h3>
    <p>
      Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this data
      protection declaration, your personal data will remain with us until the
      purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you assert a
      legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing,
      your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons
      for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or
      commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these
      reasons no longer apply.
    </p>
    <h3>Note on data transfer to the USA</h3>
    <p>
      Among other things, tools from companies based in the USA are integrated
      on our website. If these tools are active, your personal data may be
      transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like
      to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU
      data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data
      to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
      legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US
      authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently
      store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no
      influence on these processing activities.
    </p>
    <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
    <p>
      Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
      consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The
      legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
      unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct
      marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO).
    </h3>
    <p>
      IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT.
      E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
      OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS THAT ARISE FROM YOUR PARTICULAR
      SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE
      RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS
      PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL
      DATA UNLESS WE CAN IDENTIFY COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING
      THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR PROCESSING FOR THE
      PURPOSE OF ENFORCING, PURSUING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
      ACCORDING TO ART. 21 ABS. 1 DSGVO).
    </p>
    <p>
      IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE
      THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
      FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
      INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES IF YOU
      OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
      DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 (2) GDPR).
    </p>
    <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right
      of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of
      their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged
      violation. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other
      administrative or judicial remedy.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
      of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a
      third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the
      direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only
      be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
    </p>
    <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
      content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site
      operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an
      encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser
      changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your
      browser line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot
      be read by third parties.
    </p>
    <h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>
    <p>
      Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
      right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its
      origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary,
      a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well
      as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact
      us at any time.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
      personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right
      to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
        usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you
        have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
        unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead
        of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
        defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction
        of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a
        balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it
        has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right
        to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data -
      apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for
      the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection
      of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an
      important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
    </p>
    <h3>Objection to advertising e-mails</h3>
    <p>
      The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint
      obligation for the transmission of advertising and information material
      not expressly requested is hereby objected to. The operators of the pages
      expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
      unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.
    </p>
    <h2>4. data collection on this website</h2>
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p>
      The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in
      so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to
      us. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>browser type and browser version</li>
      <li>Operating system used</li>
      <li>referrer URL</li>
      <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
      <li>Time of the server request</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
    <p>
      The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The
      website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free
      presentation and optimization of its website - for this purpose, the
      server log files must be collected.
    </p>
    <h3>Inquiry by e-mail or telephone</h3>
    <p>
      If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your inquiry including all
      personal data resulting from it (name, inquiry) will be stored and
      processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass
      on this data without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your
      request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for
      the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
      processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
      of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art.
      6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this has been requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you
      request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose
      for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been
      processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention
      periods - remain unaffected.
